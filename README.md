# Web-Scraping-project
Scraping Top Repositories for Topics on GitHub

## Overview
This project demonstrates web scraping by extracting information about the top repositories for various topics on GitHub. Using Python and its ecosystem of libraries, we gather data from GitHub's website and create a structured dataset in the form of CSV file(s).

## Objectives
- Scrape GitHub to extract information about the top repositories for different topics.
- Create a structured dataset for analysis.
- Save the scraped data in CSV format for further use.

## Features
- Scrapes repository data such as:
  - Repository name
  - Description
  - Number of stars
  - Topics associated with the repository
  - Repository URL
- Generates a CSV file containing the scraped data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests to web pages.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and CSV creation.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Python installed on your system.
- Libraries installed:
  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
  ```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd web-scraping-project
   ```
3. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scrape_github_topics.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. The script sends an HTTP request to GitHub's Topics page to fetch HTML content.
2. It parses the HTML to extract information about the top repositories for each topic.
3. The extracted data is structured into a pandas DataFrame.
4. The DataFrame is exported as a CSV file.

## Output
The script generates one or more CSV files containing the following columns:
- **Repository Name**
- **Description**
- **Stars**
- **Topics**
- **Repository URL**

## Limitations
- The scraper is dependent on GitHub's current HTML structure; changes to the structure may require updates to the script.
- Adheres to GitHubâ€™s rate-limiting policies; extensive scraping may result in temporary blocks.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding support for scraping additional details, such as contributors and forks.
- Implementing error handling and retry logic for network issues.
- Integrating with a database for storing and querying the scraped data.
